When you're done, simply hit the "Submit" button to write the new changes. To cancel changes, simply close the textbox window instead.
  
## Level-Up
Two different appoaches exist to updating your character's level: 
- Manually editing the level using the double-click edit procedure outlined above.
- Clicking the "U" button next to the character's level.
Pressing the "U" button next to your character's level text box instantly increments their level by +1. Level cannot exceed 20 or fall under 1, which are the level bounds defined by D&D rules. Updating level immediately updates number of hit dice.

## Updating Race, Class, Alignment...
When updating fields such as your character's Race, Class, or Alignment, simply click on the respective field dropdown and select another option.

Making a selection will immediately update the field. Selecting a new character class will immediately update the type of hit dice, while selecting a new character race will immediately update character speed.

When you're done, simply hit the "Submit" button to write the new changes. To cancel changes, simply close the textbox window instead.
  
## Level-Up
Two different appoaches exist to updating your character's level: 
- Manually editing the level using the double-click edit procedure outlined above.
- Clicking the "U" button next to the character's level.
Pressing the "U" button next to your character's level text box instantly increments their level by +1. Level cannot exceed 20, which is the maximum level defined by D&D rules.

## Editing Name, Stats, etc... 
To edit values such as name or stats, simply double-click on the text field you wish to update. A text box will appear asking you to input the new string.

When you're done, simply hit the "Submit" button to write the new changes. To cancel changes, simply close the textbox window instead.

## Level-Up
Two different appoaches exist to updating your character's level: 
- Manually editing the level using the double-click edit procedure outlined above.
- Clicking the "U" button next to the character's level.
Pressing the "U" button next to your character's level text box instantly increments their level by +1. Level cannot exceed 20 or fall under 1, which are the level bounds defined by D&D rules. Updating level immediately updates number of hit dice.


## Updating Race, Class, Alignment...
When updating fields such as your character's Race, Class, or Alignment, simply click on the respective field dropdown and select another option.

Making a selection will immediately update the field. Selecting a new character class will immediately update the type of hit dice, while selecting a new character race will immediately update character speed.
  

## Selecting and Removing Features/Abilities...
Click on feature/ability in the "features" list to select it (highlight in blue) and display its description in the adjacent box.

- Clicking the "-" button while a feature/ability is selected instantly removes that feature/ability from the list.
  

## Adding and Editing Features/Abilities...
You can either add new ability/feature by clicking the "+" button, or double-click on a feature/ability to select and edit that ability. Both actions will open the same "Edit Feature" window and ask for the same "Feat" and "Desc" fields.

After filling in the desired fields when either adding or editing a feature/ability, click "Submit" to write the changes. You could alternatively click "Cancel" or close the editing window to cancel the operation.

- If you have chosen to add a feature/ability, it will instantly appear in the "features" list, while editing a feature/ability will automatically update the currently selection.
- When adding a feature the "description" field can be left blank, but a feature/ability name must be designated. Failure to designate a name will not submit/write the feature/ability.
- When editing a feature/ability, leaving one of the fields blank when submitting will not overwrite that field, allowing users to update a feature's/ability's name or description without having to update both.
